Two hash functions
	Claim that we will get only 25% efficiency (space)

Try to see how replication works
	How to manually shut down a node
	What happens?

Analysis
	Stats

Script that will insert hell lot of elements
	Get stats on that
		Insertion time
		Search time
		Deletion time

Epsilon(false positive rate)
	Take a look

Figure out the interfacing / libraries needed to interact with the redis cluster

What happens if we increase the number of nodes?
	Do we rearrange all elements?
	ONLY IF WE USE FINGERPRINT to select the node in the cluster, can we think about this
